[Verse 1: Bohemian Rhapsody]
Is this the real life
Is this just fantasy
Caught in a landslide
No escape from reality
Open your eyes
Look up to the skies and see

[Chorus: Bohemian Rhapsody]
Mama just killed a man
Put a gun against his head
Pulled my trigger now he's dead
Mama life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away

[Verse 1: Imagine]
Imagine there's no heaven
It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us only sky
Imagine all the people
Living for today

[Chorus: Imagine]
You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you'll join us
And the world will be as one

[Verse 1: Smells Like Teen Spirit]
Load up on guns bring your friends
It's fun to lose and to pretend
She's over bored and self assured
Oh no I know a dirty word

[Chorus: Smells Like Teen Spirit]
With the lights out it's less dangerous
Here we are now entertain us
I feel stupid and contagious
Here we are now entertain us
